# Cicada
Cicada is a robust and intuitive bug tracking and agile project management software designed specifically for student groups. Unlike [Cicada-Bug-Tracker-Project](./Cicada-Bug-Tracker-Project) (original repo for this project), this project uses React for the front-end of the application while communicating with the NodeJS back-end API to enhance real-time functionality while seamlessly integrating with a MySQL database for efficient data retrieval and management. 

Utilized: JavaScript, React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, HTML/CSS, AWS, Git, MySQL, REST API, Software design, Data analysis

Along with the project management functionalities of Cicada, a user availability tool will be integrated into the web application. The purpose of this tool will be to collaborate on a project during a period which works for all team members to ensure engagement within student-led projects!
